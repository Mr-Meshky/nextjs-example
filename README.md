## Getting Started

To create a new project based on this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-nextjs-app -e https://github.com/Mr-Meshky/nextjs-example/
```

This will create a new directory `my-nextjs-app` with all the files from this template.

```bash
cd my-nextjs-app
```

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser.
